"""Qualify every ambiguous wikilink in a workspace with the path of the note it means.

Used by `condense-vault` to fix `ambiguous-link` findings. Log dates and structural files
(`Overview`, `ProgressLog`, the indexes) repeat in every workspace by design, so a bare
`[[2026-10-01]]` or `[[Overview]]` names several notes. Obsidian binds it to one of them by its own
tie-break, which is often another project's; Foam and other viewers refuse to pick. Either way the
link is not saying what its author meant.

    qualify_links.py [--vault PATH] [--dry-run]

What it does, for every note inside a workspace (a folder with `.vault-config.json`):

  * A link whose target names more than one note is resolved against the workspace the linking
    note lives in, as its author meant it. When exactly one candidate is in that workspace, the
    target is replaced with the shortest path that names only that note:
    `[[2026-10-01]]` -> `[[Alpha/Log/2026-10-01|2026-10-01]]`.
  * The text the link displayed is kept as an alias, so the note reads the same; an existing alias
    or `#heading` is preserved. Inside a table row the alias pipe is escaped (`\\|`).
  * Links in code spans and fenced blocks, embeds, and anything outside a workspace or in
    `Archived/` are left alone. A link with no candidate, or several, in its own workspace is
    reported and left alone — that one needs a person.

Concurrent callers share rename_note.py's lock, so a rename and a qualify never interleave.
