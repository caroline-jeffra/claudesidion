"""Maintain a project workspace's derived metadata and indexes.

This is a MAINTENANCE tool, not a migration tool. It runs on every session end
against a workspace that already has the right shape, and it is deliberately
constrained:

  * It NEVER deletes a file, moves a file, or edits a note's body.
  * It only rewrites index notes, and only the frontmatter of ordinary notes.
  * Every write is compare-before-write, so a no-op run touches nothing.
  * It fails open: any unexpected error exits 0 with a message on stderr, so a
    bug here can never break a session or block the vault push.

What it does, per workspace:
  1. Reads every note's frontmatter.
  2. Fills in derived fields on notes that lack them — `type` (inferred from
     the folder the note is in), `topics` (matched from the workspace's topic
     vocabulary), and the derived `topic/*` / doctype tags.
  3. Regenerates the index notes from what it found.

With `--lint`, it writes nothing at all: it reports every note that breaks the format contract
(skills/manage-project-workspaces/reference/structure.md), one line each, for `condense-vault` to
work through. `--lint --count` prints only the number of findings.

A workspace opts in by containing a `.vault-config.json`. Workspaces without
one are ignored entirely, so this is safe to run across a mixed vault where
most projects still use the old flat layout.
