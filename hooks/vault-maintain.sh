# Session-end step: refresh derived metadata and regenerate indexes for any vault
# workspace that opts in with a `.vault-config.json`.
#
# session-end.sh runs it BEFORE vault-push.sh, so the regenerated indexes are
# committed in the same commit as the notes that changed them.
#
# This never deletes or moves a file and never edits a note body — it only fills
# in derived frontmatter and rewrites generated index notes. See
# hooks/vault_maintain.py for the guarantees.
#
# Fails open on every path: if anything is missing or goes wrong, exit 0 with no
# output so a hook bug can never break the user's session teardown.
