# Never `git add -A`. The vault is a directory on the user's disk, and anything sitting in it at
# session end is not necessarily something the plugin wrote or that the user wants published —
# a stray .env, a key, a scratch file. Two filters, both conservative:
#
#   1. Only paths the plugin's own conventions own (see is_owned_path). Anything else is
#      reported, not committed, so an unexpected file is surfaced rather than silently published.
#   2. Never anything matching a secret-shaped name, even inside an owned path. This list can
#      never be complete, which is why the vault also ships a .gitignore — but a partial guard
#      that catches the common cases beats none.
#
# core.quotepath=off is required throughout: without it git escapes non-ASCII bytes and quotes
# the whole path, so notes with em-dashes or arrows in their names never match.

# Paths deliberately not committed and not reported. Archived/ holds retired workspaces that are
# expendable by design; the plugin does not maintain them, so it neither publishes nor nags.
