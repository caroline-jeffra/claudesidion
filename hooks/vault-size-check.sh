Surface this to the user and offer to fix each file: for markdown, split it at a natural boundary (per year/month or per topic) and update wikilinks; if it is bloated by embedded base64 images or pasted data dumps, extract those into attachment files; for genuinely binary files, suggest Git LFS. Do not modify any file without the user's confirmation."
